Project Description:
We are working with data from the entertainment application Procrastinate Pro+. Despite huge investments in advertising, the company has been operating at a loss for the past few months. Our task is to investigate the causes and help the company turn a profit.

We have data on the users who were attracted from May 1 to October 27, 2019, including:

server logs with information about their visits
data on their purchases during this period
advertising expenses
Our objectives are to:

analyze where users come from and what devices they use
determine the cost of attracting users from different advertising channels
calculate how much revenue each customer generates
identify when the cost of acquiring a customer is paid off
determine which factors are hindering customer acquisition.
